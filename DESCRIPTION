Description: Tools to create binary dosage files from either VCF
    or GEN files, merge binary dosage files, and read
    binary dosage files. Binary dosage files tend to have quicker
    read times than VCF and GEN formats. There is a small increase
    increase in size compared to compressed VCF and GEN files.
